# How to Start 'Shinesoon'

Since the automated setup script cannot run directly in this environment (due to missing `npm` in the path here), please follow these steps:

## Option 1: One-Click Setup (Recommended)
1.  Navigate to the project folder: 
    `c:\Users\HarichandruThirumuru\.gemini\antigravity\brain\090b0221-d6b1-4aa8-aea4-7fe45665b5ad\ShineSoon`
2.  Double-click the file named **`setup_and_run.bat`**.
3.  This will open a terminal window, install all dependencies for both Server and Client, and launch the application automatically.

## Option 2: Manual Setup
If the script doesn't work, open your terminal (PowerShell or Command Prompt) and run:

### 1. Start Backend
```bash
cd server
npm install
npm run dev
```

### 2. Start Frontend
Open a **new** terminal window:
```bash
cd client
npm install
npm run dev
```

Access the app at: http://localhost:5173
